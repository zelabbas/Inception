# The output you provided indicates that MariaDB is expecting to use the Unix socket located at /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock, but the socket file does not exist (No such file or directory). This suggests that MariaDB did not start successfully or the socket file was not created.

# Steps to resolve the issue:
# 1. Ensure the /run/mysqld directory exists:
# Run the following command to ensure that the required directory exists and has the correct permissions:
# ======> mariadb --help to show all info about mariadb 
# bash
# Copy code
# mkdir -p /run/mysqld
# chown -R mysql:mysql /run/mysqld
# This command will create the directory if it doesn't exist and ensure it is owned by the mysql user, which is necessary for MariaDB to create the socket file.
